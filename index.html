            <p>Hello! My name is Kaylee Godfrey. I’m from Alabama, but I’ve moved around a lot throughout my life—Texas,
                Arizona, St.
                George, and now Idaho. All that moving helped me get comfortable with change and gave me the chance to
                experience so
                many different places and people.

                A huge part of my story is my mission in Yakima, Washington. It was a time of a lot of growth for me,
                and it’s also
                where I met my husband. After returning home, we were married in the St. George Temple right after the
                renovations were
                finished, which made the day feel even more meaningful. We’ve now been married for a year and are both
                studying at
                BYU–Idaho.

                I’m majoring in web and graphic design, and I work as the web designer for Built Marketing. I love being
                creative—whether I’m designing, cooking, or traveling with my husband. I’m excited to keep developing my
                skills and
                learn even more about building clean, intentional websites this semester.</p>

            <h2>Idaho</h2>
            <img src="images/boise-3864184_640.jpg" alt="Beautiful Idaho mountains and lakes">
            <p>Idaho has a rich but simple history, beginning with Native American tribes such as the Nez Perce and
                Shoshone-Bannock
                who lived on the land long before early explorers and settlers arrived. Idaho officially became the 43rd
                state in 1890,
                and over time it grew through mining, farming, and the hardworking communities that shaped it.

                Today, Idaho is loved for its incredible natural beauty. The state is full of mountain ranges, forest
                trails, hot
                springs, and clear lakes that make it a dream for anyone who enjoys the outdoors. Places like Sun
                Valley, Coeur d’Alene,
                and Yellowstone’s edge draw tourists year-round. Whether you're hiking in the Sawtooths, exploring
                scenic byways, or
                just enjoying a quiet sunset over the fields, Idaho offers a peaceful, adventure-filled experience in
                every season.</p>
